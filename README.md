Course Project for SI 618 -- Data Manipulation & Analysis

Author: Zhiyi Ji, Ruizhe Wang

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews Dataset**, which contains detailed information on over 8,000 beauty products and 1 million customer reviews. The dataset provides key insights into the cosmetic industry through product attributes, prices, ingredients, and customer feedback. 

Our primary objective is to identify **factors that drive higher product ratings** and understand how ingredients, prices, and product types influence customer satisfaction. Additionally, we aim to explore why certain products underperform by analyzing user reviews. Beyond ratings, we will investigate **trends in consumer sentiment** over time by different categories and assess the impact of movements like "clean beauty" and seasonal variations in feedback. 

Using **data analysis, machine learning, and visualization**, we intend to uncover patterns in customer behavior, empowering brands to align their strategies with customer needs and industry trends.

## Motivation

The cosmetic and skincare industry is evolving rapidly, with consumers becoming more focused on **tailored solutions and sustainable products**. Customer reviews are now essential in shaping brand reputations and guiding purchase decisions. This project is motivated by a desire to understand **what drives customer satisfaction**, allowing businesses to improve product offerings based on consumer needs. 

Specifically, we aim to address the following **3 real-world questions**:
1. **What factors drive higher product ratings?** Why do certain products underperform?  
   - What we hope to learn: Identify which product attributes (e.g., ingredients, price) are linked to higher satisfaction and uncover common issues affecting low-rated products. We also want to generate methods to resolve the issues. 

2. **How does customer sentiment change over time?**  
   - What we hope to learn: Analyze shifts in customer feedback and assess the impact of trends (e.g. "clean beauty") to better understand evolving preferences.  

3. **Are certain ingredients linked to positive or negative customer experiences?**  
   - What we hope to learn: Detect patterns in ingredient preferences and identify sources of customer dissatisfaction.  

Through this analysis, we hope to generate **actionable insights** that help brands meet customer expectations, avoid problematic ingredients, and **enhance customer experiences**.
